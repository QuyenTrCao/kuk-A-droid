How to transform the KUKA youBot mobile manipulator into your buddy!

The big idea
============

Kuk-A-droid is a human-robot interaction (HRI) project. Several famous robots designed for social interactions have a shape closed to humans, like a full humanoid body or a human-like face. This project takes the opportunity of the KUKA innovation award to design what would be social interactions in the case of a robot with no human attributes, the youBot.

As a side project, a part of the technical landscape will be based on an Android handset. This will help to provide cheap sensors in the short term, and more important, a part of the code could be reuse to develop similar properties to other robots.

Crazy isn'y-it? Yes, and that's the fun!
